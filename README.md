# Django-Authentication
This simple project shown how to use the simplest registration and authentication django system. Even if this way is a poor method because it is not safe, I hope I may show how this system works, and take advantage of this to make the MVP(minimun viable product). You can hide some information in html template without unauthorized user can see. In the same way, you can hide links, but these links will be accessible. To get it in a more efficient way, you should use a views decorator. 

## Getting Started
* $ git clone https://github.com/victor-s-santos/django-authentication.git # to clone the repository
* cd django-authentication # to get in the new directory
* python -m venv .venv # to create the virtual environment
* python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate # to migrate the models to database
* python manage.py runserverver # to run your local server

* As this repository don't use any additional lib, only pure django, don't be necessary to install anything with pip.

### Prerequisites
Python 3.X
Django 2.X #even this could be do with another previous django version, there are some fix to do in this case.
